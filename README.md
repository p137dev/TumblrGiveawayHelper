# TumblrGiveawayHelper

This project was meant to be a tool to assist artists in organizing "giveaways" on Tumblr.

Unfortunately, it was based on notes and Tumblr returns only 50 of these (same goes for Tumblr API). Moreover, Tumblr's TOS makes it clear that they don't want Tumblr to be scraped.

TumblrGiveawayHelper is based on Ruby on Rails 4, jQuery & Bootstrap for styling, Nokogiri for scraping  and SQLite3 for DB purposes.

The project won't be developed anymore, but I really enjoyed making it, so here it is. Maybe someone will find it helpful one day.
